# How to Run the Code Using G++ Locally
## 1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
## 2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
## 3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
## 4. Compile the code using your C++ compiler. For example, if you're using g++, you can run:
  ```bash
  g++ -o main main.cpp
 ```
## 5. After successful compilation, run the executable file:
  ```bash
 ./main

# How to modify to become an "official" assignment
## Clarify use of live user input (should accept input while program runs or just provide static example in main() )
## Provide test cases to ensure correctness of results
## Specify where to host project (I think Replit is helpful for others to run/look at source code for a C++ program)
